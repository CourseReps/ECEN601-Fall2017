# Challenge 1
The purpose of Challenge 1 is to gain experience with computing in Python, as it pertains to vector space methods.
This challenge assumes that you are already familiar with [Python](https://www.python.org/), and you have a working development environment.
You should also be versed in using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## SciPy
[SciPy](https://scipy.org/) is a Python-based collection of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering.
For instance, it offers a collection of numerical algorithms for domain-specific computations including signal processing, optimization, and statistics.
 * [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) is the fundamental package for numerical computation; it defines the numerical array and matrix types and basic operations on them.
 * [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) provides high-performance, easy to use data structures.
 * [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is a plotting package that provides a collection of functions to create figures.
